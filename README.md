"PyBank" analyzes the finances of a company by finding the Total Months represented in the data, the sum of all profits and losses for the months listed, the average profit/loss for the months listed, and the months with the greatest increases and decreases in profits, along with those values. This was achieved using Python code. 

"PyPoll" tabulated votes from an election in a small town by finding the total number of votes, a list of all candidates who received votes, the total number of votes received by each candidate, the percentage of total votes received by each candidate, and the winner of the election.
